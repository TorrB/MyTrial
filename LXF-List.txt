Click here to get the DVD via BitTorrent
	.Ubuntu 12.04 vs Windows 8: we throw them both to our merciless testers.
	.We've been hearing from Canonical for ages about how Ubuntu is trying to attract new users to Linux, which is why the company doesn't seem too bothered to be losing ground to Mint: it figures that it will more than replace them with people who are new to computers and may not even have heard of Linux. So why not compare it with another operating system that's also had a renaissance: Windows 8? Let the battle of the reinvented desktop paradigms commence!
	.Also in the issue we talk to Allison Randal, technical architect of Ubuntu, about how the Unity experiment is going and how the HUD fits into Canonical's grand plan, and hear from the Ubuntu Community Manager Jono Bacon about how best to report bugs without making developers want to kill you. Choose the best package manager for your Linux system, take a trip back in time with our hands-on guide to emulating classic games consoles, and empathise with the late nights Graham had to put in to bring you the definitive viewpoint on MythTV 0.25. All this and more in your new Ubuntu Format! Er, Linux Format!

Click here to get the DVD via BitTorrent
	.They say you should never meet your heroes, but we ignore their advice and travelled to the home of Linus Torvalds to ask him about Gnome, KDE, Android, Apple, Ubuntu and Google. It was pretty cool, and you can read everything that he had to say to us in this issue. Also in the issue we take a look back at the evolution of the Linux desktop, compare C, Perl and Python to see how our existing programming knowledge translates to new languages, and try out the high-performance computing benchmarking software used by the physicists at CERN and Swansea. We report from Liverpool on the UK's OggCamp unconference, and make the hostile environment of The Outside World easier to navigate with OpenStreetMap.

164 (December 2012) - Linux at CERN
Click here to get the DVD via BitTorrent
	.Yes, CERN!
	.The hunt for the Higgs boson, the so-called God Particle that so angered Ewan McGregor, generates an enormous amount of data. And what kind of OS do think runs the machines that wrangle this data? It's not a trick question: the answer is Linux, because it's powerful, it's open, it's hackable, extensible, scalable and lots of other things that you can read about in this issue.
	.Also in this, the most amazing magazine ever committed to paper/electrons, we have an EXCLUSIVE chat with Red Hat's man inside the US government, who tells us why Linux on US Navy drones isn't such a big deal after all; play with Razor-qt, a low-calorie version of the KDE desktop; and take an EXCLUSIVE look back at the philosophers of old to find out why we feel so smug every time we boot into Debian.
	.All this, plus Android, Python and our EXCLUSIVE Code Concepts tutorials, and the corpse of a Spectrum ZX81 being desecrated with a Raspberry Pi. It can only be Linux Format!

Click here to get the DVD via BitTorrent
	.OK, we`re being a little bit daft about the zombies, but they`re a useful metaphor for all the things that can go wrong with data stored on a Linux box. Partitions go missing, files get deleted by accident, and zombies pull out the plug of your PC just as you`re saving something to disk. It`s bad juju, but with our guide to surviving data disaster you`ll be prepared. Also in the magazine we round up the best new desktop environments, because we`re getting sick of Unity and Gnome 3, we talk to selection of Linux wise men to find out what they think the big issues in free software are, and we also make browsing the web a safer experience with our look at parental controls for Linux. On the tutorial front we build a custom distro for a Raspberry Pi the hard way, learn recursion with Scheme and get coding with the Geany IDE, among others.

168 (March 2013) - Linux vs Windows 8: The verdict
Click here to get the DVD via BitTorrent
	.Microsoft has been alienating its users by making pointless user interface changes, dropping support for its instant messenger app and not providing software that will play a DVD. We can either: a) Point and laugh like Nelson the bully from The Simpsons; or b) show the poor, huddled masses of Windows users that there is a better way. Or, if you don't use Windows and don't know anybody who does, you can simply marvel at how much better off you are because you use Linux, and congratulate yourself on your sound judgement. Also in the magazine! There's coding a-plenty, with an introduction to Ruby, a beginner's tutorial on Scratch and the latest installment of our Django series. You can assuage your fears over UEFI, wrange KDE 4 to your personal preference with our missing manual, write your own command-line tool, discover the best photo editor for Linux and find out why free software developers should learn from the Bible.

	.Choice is natural. Choice ensures competition. Choice is good. But sometimes there's too much choice, and we need a helping hand through the forest of indecision. Take the act of choosing a Linux distribution, for example: of the hundreds that are out there, all with their slightly different goals and values, how do you know which one is going to be right for you? You could try every single one of the top 50 ranked Linux flavours on Distrowatch, or you could let us do it for you – brilliant!

Click here to get the DVD via BitTorrent
	.We asked in the latest Tuxradar podcast for the reasons that you change distro. The most frequent one was the choice of desktop. But you don't have to ditch your whole distro in order to get a new user interface: you can follow our Technical Editor Ben's advice and find the desktop that's right for you, so you end up bossing your Linux machine around rather than it controlling you. Elsewhere in the magazine we've more desktoppery, as we follow Linux Torvalds' advice and tweak Gnome with a tool called Gnome-Tweak-Tool, and the Unity/KDE 4/Gnome 3 debate rumbles on in the letters pages. Back in the world of Real Work, we manage multiple machines with Puppet, get a better filesystem with btrfs and learn how to buy Aeroflot tickets to Caracas without anyone finding out, with our roundup of the finest anonymising distros known to man.

176 (November 2013) - Build your own distro
Click here to get the DVD via BitTorrent
	.Making stuff is fun. Putting bits together, taking them apart again to see how it works, putting them back together in a slightly different way: it's incredibly satisfying. This is why we decided to devote eight pages to building your own distro. Three different methods, infinite possibilities. The only limit is the number of rainy days you'll have to do it all (let's face it: we have plenty of rainy days to play with). Also in the issue: hear from the Gnome Foundation's executive director, and come away buzzing with fresh enthusiasm for free software. If you're into buzzwords – or deploying web apps to the cloud easily – you'll appreciate Mr Nick Veitch's tutorial on Juju Charms. And if you like talking to other human beings you'll want to know all about the Ubuntu for Phones OS, which looks to us like a real winner. or at least, it will be, if Canonical can get it to market before Sailfish. All this, plus coding, reviews and more, only in Linux Format!

191 (December 2014) - Hack the Raspberry Pi
Click here to get the DVD via BitTorrent
	.Over the last year here in the UK open source has seeped into our government infrastructure and is now part of the school curriculum, championed a good deal by the Raspberry Pi foundation. To help celebrate this fortunate turn of events we're exploring how you can hack Linux on the Pi to ever greater levels with fun projects, advanced Linux services and essential skills, we hope you've brought your Pi with you. Not that we want to obsess on the Pi too much, it's a great device that's changing the world, but part of that success is its Linux smarts. We're finishing our Nginx series, we're also going deep into Cython to accelerate everyday Python, exploring how to use Git for your own projects and look at how you can get started developing PHP. We're also trying to stay musical with a roundup of excellent players and even pro-level production with JACK. Plus even more advanced tutorials, reviews and a packed DVD.

192 (Christmas 2014) - Power Up
Click here to get the DVD via BitTorrent
	.We’re powering up this issue, but this time it’s your brain that’s getting the upgrade (don’t worry it won’t hurt a bit). Your inner Tux is about to get a super-boost of FOSS knowledge. So prepare your sedated synapses, wake your napping neurons and gather your grey matter for an influx of distro secrets and the inner workings of the GNU/Linux system underbelly. You can’t understate how important this system-level knowledge is. It’s valued highly by old-school system admins and enables you to grapple with the inner workings of Linux unlike anything else. It’s so highly prized that recent changes to the Debian caused a group of ‘veteran Unix admins’ aka Unix grey-beards to threaten to (all together now) fork it, find out more over at http://debianfork.org. It’s the old cliché that no one likes change, the loss of SysV init for Systemd, plus the emphasis on the Gnome desktop has got the backs up of a bunch of old-timers alongside other groups that are against the supposed feature creep of Systemd. Like or loath Systemd, the Debian board democratically debated and selected it as the new init (SysV also remains in there) so asking it to then renege on that democratically made decision feels wrong. It’s like the FOSS Godfather is making us an offer we can’t refuse. But it’s their freedom to fork Debian and good luck to them, just quit with the threats. Life remains very exciting in the world of Linux we’ve managed to condense just a fraction of the developments that are taking place in the open source world. To kick things off we’ve got a full report and interviews with the people at Oggcamp 2014, (p42) hearing from the movers and shakers about developments this year. Our lad Jonni has been very busy building a Linux NAS box on page 46, creating the game 2048 inside of Minecraft, of all places, and using Mathematica to control Pi gadgets. Finally, an area we’ve wanted to explore for a long time is robotics and we look at how you can get started building a Linux-powered robot on page 52. With Ubuntu 14.10 on the disc this issue should keep you very busy!

193 (January 2015) - Build a Linux media server
Click here to get the DVD via BitTorrent
	.Let’s play a game: imagine a world with no open source software. Imagine Steve Ballmer invented a time machine, went back to 1953 and prevented the birth of Richard Stallman, the father of the Free Software Foundation. Overnight, everything open source vanishes from the face of the planet – but what changes? Of course, GNU/Linux disappears. Something like 75% of the world’s web servers grind to a halt or have to switch to Windows. You can kiss goodbye to every Android phone and tablet too. You’re OK as you’re an Apple owner? Nope, the Darwin kernel is based in part on the open source BSD kernel, while Safari uses the open source WebKit, to take just two examples of the open source elements that power both its mobile iOS and desktop OS X operating systems. We’d be left in a world of Windows, but without iOS and Android to compete against, Microsoft would have been happy to continue flogging us all its Windows Mobile OS and Windows XP on the desktop. And with so many web technologies based on open source and open platforms, the internet as we know it would cease to exist: we’ve already kissed goodbye to Safari, but bang goes Chrome, Firefox, WordPress, Docker, OpenStack and OpenSSL – the list goes on and on. This was just a silly academic exercise, but the point is to show how widely open source is used. It increases choice: Android can be adopted and adapted by any company. It speeds adoption of technologies: source code has to be made publicly available, so everyone can use it and contribute to it. It reduces costs: there’s no need to develop technologies from scratch or buy them in at great cost, and tried and tested code can be reused. It fuels standards: Docker is a cloud phenomena that even Microsoft has to embrace. So as you read this issue, taking in open source media centres, streaming standards, open server systems, Minecraft alternatives, filesystems, drawing packages, OpenLDAP, alternative kernels, programming and so much more, just thank Stallman* open source exists at all.
	.*We realise someone else would have championed the philosophy, but as well as katana-wielding Stallman? Never!

Click here to get the DVD via BitTorrent
	.Next-gen GNU/Linux, what does that even mean? The FOSS world is so unlike the proprietary world. In that closed universe, new releases are considered so important that secrecy becomes paramount. So the next-gen release of Windows becomes so crucial. With FOSS and Linux development everything is laid bare. Sensible folk stick with the stable release but the brave-hearted can jump into an unstable, development branch and compile where angels fear to tread. This issue we’re looking at those ‘next-gen’ developments, the key technologies that have been in development for the last few years and will become mainstream through 2015. If you’re even brave enough we’ll show you how you can jump onboard with your own build of Ubuntu or Arch and try them live. Neil “Grey Beard” Bothwick is your guide!

195 (March 2015) - Raspberry Pi 2
Click here to get the DVD via BitTorrent
	.The global phenomena that is the Raspberry Pi enters its next phase and is taking Linux with it, not so much kicking and screaming, but more skipping merrily through classrooms, workshops and coding clubs around the world. A charitable venture that was originally envisioned to produce a few thousand Pis has become an educational gateway to Linux for literally millions of new users. Crucially not any old users but a new generation of programmers, developers, system admins, kernel contributors, bug hunters and security experts. All open-eyed and open-minded to the open source way.
	.Boys and girls as young as seven are coding with Linux. I can't emphasise how vital this is, as it has been noted that the age of developers maintaining crucial elements of the Linux world are ageing. We jokingly call them greybeards, but unless a new generation comes along to maintain those distros the open source world is going to find itself in trouble.
	.That’s why it’s amazing news an all-new Raspberry Pi is on its way. We’ve got complete in-depth coverage on the Pi, with a report on the launch event. We’ll of course have more coverage over the year, so stick with us or even save yourself some money and subscribe.

197 (May 2015) - Ingenious Raspberry Pi Projects
Click here to get the DVD via BitTorrent
	.Welcome to Raspberry Pi Format, or at least that’s what it might feel like to some regular readers. The truth is, considering just how popular the Raspberry Pi has become – it’s easily the fastest-selling UK home computer and will likely even surpass the 12 million Amstrads managed during the entire ‘80s and ‘90s – we barely give it coverage. So with five million original Pi users and thousands of new Pi 2 owners gnashing at the bit for exciting projects to try and coding knowledge to learn, it’s about time for another Pi issue. So with the Raspberry Pi Foundation celebrating three years of the Raspberry Pi and an entirely new model, we thought it’d be a fine time to cover the Pi Party and dive into our best-new Raspberry Pi projects with Pi-expert and general Linux-socialite Les Pounder.
	.Even so, those 15 packed pages are just 15% of the total magazine which we’re devoting to the Pi, which does run GNU/Linux at its heart, so it’s still Linux. The rest of Linux Format retains its usual focus on hard-core desktop and server Linux. Just take a look at the Virtual Machine Roundup, it shows how things are always evolving and we think VirtualBox has finally lost its virtual crown.
	.Talking of change you’ve more than likely heard that Ubuntu Phone is here, and we’ve reviewed the Meizu MX4 Ubuntu Edition. This is THE Ubuntu Phone to have, challenging the best of the mobile world with its octa-core processor and low cost. Mr Brown explains the challenges a sysadmin has fending off exploits, Doc Brown continues his programming master-class for sysadmins and if you’re up for a challenge why not tackle functional programming with Haskell. If all that’s a bit too much, you can grab our cover disc this month and install SteamOS for some gaming fun by following the in-depth guide. There’s never been a better time to have fun with Linux!
